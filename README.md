Mission RandD. I was one among the 15 students selected from 120 students for Mission RandD program. This program's main was to teach coding to students. It consisted of levels of coding rounds where students will be eleminated based on their performance as complexity of class teachings increases. I am proud that I lasted till the end of this program.
